# EV Supply Chain Emission Simulator

Repository for:

Alsaleh T. & Farooq B. (2025) **Simulation models for sustainable, resilient, and optimized global electric vehicles supply chain**, Scientific Reports. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-28899-2

This repository contains the dataset and the script files for the EV supply chain emission simulator. It also contains the optimization model cost matrices and optimization scripts.

The repository directory has two main folders:
1. **Simulation Model:** Contains relevant data and script files for the emission simulator.
2. **Optimization Model:** Contains the cost matrices and script files for optimization.

Additionally, the repository contains the visualization scripts and data, as well as the scripts and the data analysis for emissions per transport mode, market, manufacturers, and others based on the simulation outputs.
